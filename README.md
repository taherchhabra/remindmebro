## The Simplest Email Reminder Service

Do you send lot of emails ? 
Sometimes people are busy and don't reply and you have to remind them.
Even you are busy and you also forget. 

What happens then ? We all know.

Be proactive, use RemindMeBro and never miss sending a followup email.

It's as simple as adding a 1day@remindmebro.com in the bcc and it will remind you after 1 day to do the followup

Similarly you can add in the bcc

1minute@RemindMeBro.com  ( get a reminder after 1 min )
2minutes@RemindmeBro.com  ( get a reminder after 2 min )
3days@remindMeBro.com  ( get a reminder after 3 days )
10days@remindMeBro.com  ( get a reminder after 10 days )
